# Kinetic Typography

## Definition
A style where text is the primary visual element and moves, morphs, or responds to interaction. It communicates emotion, energy, and emphasis through motion.

## Intent and use
- Draw attention, guide reading flow, and add expressive personality.
- Ideal for hero sections, campaigns, landing pages, and motion-heavy UI.

## Color palettes (examples)
- **High Contrast**: #FFFFFF (white), #111111 (black), #FF4D4F (accent), #3D6DFF (accent), #FFD400 (accent)
- **Neon Type**: #0F1115 (dark), #F2F5F9 (light), #00E5FF (cyan), #C400FF (violet), #FFB800 (yellow)
- **Mono + Pop**: #F7F7F7 (light), #1F1F1F (text), #FF6B6B (accent), #4ECDC4 (accent), #FFE66D (accent)

## Design rules
- **Motion**: use easing curves, spring effects, and timing for readability.
- **Hierarchy**: motion should reinforce structure, not replace it.
- **Legibility**: avoid excessive distortion on body text.
- **Rhythm**: stagger animation to guide scanning order.

## Typography (fonts available in Penpot)
Use variable or bold families to support motion.
- **Headlines**: "Inter", "Sora", "Roboto Flex", "Plus Jakarta Sans", "Space Grotesk"
- **Body**: "Inter", "Public Sans", "Work Sans"
- **Display accents**: "Bungee", "Bebas Neue", "Anton" (short only)

## Layout and components
- **Hero** with animated headline and static supporting text.
- **Buttons** with subtle text motion on hover.
- **Headlines** with weight or width animation (variable fonts).

## Illustration and imagery
- Minimal; let typography be the main visual.
- Use abstract shapes to frame animated text.

## Accessibility
- Provide reduce motion option.
- Keep readable static fallback states.
