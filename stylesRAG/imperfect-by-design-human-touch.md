# Imperfect by Design / Human Touch

## Definition
A deliberately imperfect style that celebrates human marks: hand-drawn strokes, collage, uneven alignment, and raw textures. It counters algorithmic polish with personality, warmth, and visible process.

## Intent and use
- Add authenticity and a handcrafted feel.
- Make brand voice feel personal and approachable.
- Ideal for artisanal products, community projects, indie brands, education, and cultural events.

- **Layout**: asymmetry, collage blocks, off-grid alignment, intentional misplacement.
- **Textures**: grain, paper fibers, ink bleed, scan noise, photocopy artifacts.
- **Edges**: torn paper, rough masks, imperfect cutouts.
- **Hierarchy**: bold, irregular headings; clear body text for usability.
- **Contrast**: mix high-contrast highlights with neutral backgrounds.
- **Rhythm**: embrace controlled chaos; avoid perfect repetition.
