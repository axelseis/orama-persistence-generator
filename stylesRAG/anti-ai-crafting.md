# Anti-AI Crafting

## Definition
A style that foregrounds human-made artifacts and analog techniques to signal authenticity. It emphasizes visible process: texture, imperfection, and handcrafted materials over algorithmic polish.

## Intent and use
- Communicate authenticity, craftsmanship, and cultural depth.
- Differentiate from generic AI-generated aesthetics.
- Ideal for artisanal goods, premium packaging, sustainability brands, and heritage storytelling.

## Design rules
- **Materiality**: show paper fibers, ink bleed, emboss, letterpress, or stitched textures.
- **Composition**: allow uneven margins, organic spacing, and asymmetry.
- **Edges**: rough cuts, torn paper, and imperfect masks.
- **Details**: stamps, seals, hand-numbering, or hand-drawn annotations.
- **Imagery**: favor scanned or photographed real materials over synthetic effects.
