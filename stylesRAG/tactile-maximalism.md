# Tactile Maximalism (Squishy-uishy UI)

## Definition
A sensory digital style that moves away from flat coldness and prioritizes volume, texture, and elastic response. Elements feel soft, with rounded edges, diffuse shadows, and microinteractions that simulate press and bounce.

## Intent and use
- Create friendly, playful, and memorable interfaces.
- Reinforce the feeling of digital touch in UI.
- Ideal for creative products, education, wellness, entertainment, and brands with a warm tone.

## Color palettes (examples)
- **Warm Gel**: #FFB3C7 (pink), #FFD59A (peach), #FFF3D6 (cream), #BFE7FF (sky blue), #6B6B6B (text gray)
- **Candy Volume**: #FF7AD9 (magenta), #8A7CFF (violet), #6BE3FF (cyan), #FFE58F (yellow), #1F1F1F (text)
- **Soft Clay**: #EAC7B2 (clay), #F5E8D8 (sand), #C7D3C2 (sage), #A7C4E0 (dusty blue), #3B3B3B (text)

## Design rules
- **Shapes**: very rounded corners, blobs, capsules, and cards with large radii.
- **Volume**: soft shadows, smooth gradients, layers with subtle relief.
- **Textures**: gel, rubber, clay, claymorphism.
- **Space**: generous internal padding; avoid high density.
- **Contrast**: high typographic contrast; medium color contrast.
- **Feedback**: microinteractions with gentle bounce (scale, spring, ease-out).
- **Depth**: hierarchy by layers (z-depth), not hard lines.

## Typography (fonts available in Penpot)
Prioritize rounded, friendly sans with strong weights.
- **Headings**: "Baloo 2", "Fredoka", "M PLUS Rounded 1c", "Comfortaa"
- **Body**: "Nunito", "Poppins", "Rubik", "Quicksand", "Varela Round"
- **Accents** (if contrast is needed): "Bree Serif"

Optional loud accents (use only for short words, badges, or onboarding):
- **Display**: "Bungee", "Bungee Inline", "Nabla", "Rubik Glitch", "Tilt Neon", "Sixtyfour", "VT323", "Space Mono"
- **Rule**: avoid display fonts in navigation or functional UI text for accessibility.

## Layout and components
- **Cards** with soft shadow and pastel backgrounds.
- **Buttons** large, rounded, with elastic hover and soft inner shadow.
- **Inputs** with soft borders and a subtle focus glow.
- **Badges** as volumetric bubbles.
- **Icons** with soft 3D style or rounded strokes.

## Illustration and imagery
- Soft 3D clay-like models.
- Illustrations with simple volumes and diffuse highlights.
- Smooth gradients, no hard edges.

## Accessibility
- Keep sufficient contrast for text (especially on pastels).
- Do not rely only on color for states.
- Gentle animations with a reduce motion option.
